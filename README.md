# Fertilizer Optimizer

## Project Description

Fertilizer Optimizer is a tool for agronomists and gardeners, developed on the .NET platform, that helps optimize the composition of fertilizers to achieve a specified nutrient concentration (measured in PPM - parts per million) in the mixture. The tool not only helps calculate the necessary amount of each fertilizer to achieve the desired PPM profile but can also analyze fertilizer mixtures, provide the current PPM profile, and suggest optimal mixture recipes based on the specified PPM profile.

## Features

- **PPM Calculation**: Enter your fertilizer mixture, and the tool will calculate the current PPM profile of each nutrient, including both macro and microelements.
- **Fertilizer Mixture Optimization**: Specify the desired PPM profile, and the tool will offer optimal fertilizer recipes to achieve the specified concentration. The tool includes a database of more than 30 fertilizers and is capable of proposing the maximum number of recipes with optimal fertilizer ratios.
- **Custom Fertilizer Construction**: Users can create their own fertilizers by setting their composition according to their own needs and available resources, providing maximum flexibility in mixture selection.
- **Atom Directory and Fertilizer Composition**: The tool contains an atom directory used for accurate calculations of fertilizer composition. Users can set the composition of each fertilizer, allowing for highly accurate PPM profile calculations based on the actual content of elements in the fertilizers.

## User Benefits

This tool can be especially useful for both professional agronomists and gardening enthusiasts who aim to precisely select fertilizers for their plants. Thanks to the wide selection of fertilizers and the ability to create various mixtures, users can experiment and find the best solutions for their gardens and fields. For commercial organizations, implementing the Fertilizer Optimizer allows stores to provide a unique service to their customers: based on a specified PPM profile, necessary fertilizers can be selected from the store's current inventory. This makes the purchase of fertilizers more targeted and economically beneficial for the customer, as they receive exactly the fertilizers that are optimal for their agricultural needs.
